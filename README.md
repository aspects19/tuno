|------------|----------------|
| UI | [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) |
| Playback | [ExoPlayer](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/exoplayer) |

## 🏗️ Architecture

Tuno uses a **simple MVVM structure**:
- **`SharedMusicViewModel`** — holds the list of songs and the selected music
- **`PlayerController`** — wraps and manages ExoPlayer playback
- **`NowPlaying`** screen — composable that renders the UI and binds to player state

This keeps logic separate, lifecycle-safe, and easy to extend.
